# DataUrl.xyz

Craft responses with arbitrary content type and content with a permanent, sharebale URL. All data is compressed and url safe 
encoded. It is packed into the URL path so a database is not required to store the data at the endpoint. The information is
entirely in the path. 

## Use Cases

1) Quickly craft an endpoint without needing to setup a server or database.
